# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple Python terminal-based rock-paper-scissors game. The player enters a choice, and the computer randomly picks one. The game then announces the winner.

## Features
- Random computer choice using Python’s `random` module
- User input and basic input validation
- Clean output showing both choices and result
- Organized using functions

## What I Learned
- Using Python’s `input()` and `random.choice()`
- Writing and calling functions
- Applying conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Organizing small projects into clean, reusable code

## How to Run
1. Save the file as `rock_paper_scissors.py`
2. In terminal or command prompt, run:
```bash
python rock_paper_scissors.py
